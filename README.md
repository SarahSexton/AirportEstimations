# AirportEstimations
A web-based "Airport Estimations" form that estimates various times related to the airport journey. 
If you're trying to catch a flight, you can put in your information. 
It calculates the estimated time your flight starts boarding, walking to your gate, and when to leave your home/start your journey. 
Ensure you're packed on time with these results!
